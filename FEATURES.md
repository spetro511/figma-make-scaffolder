# Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes three feature additions to the Figma Make Scaffolder VS Code extension that align with the latest updates from Figma Make and enhance the developer experience.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Import Fix Reporting (Feature 2)

**Purpose**: Provide transparency and visibility into the automatic import fixing process.

**Implementation**:
- Created `ImportFixReport` interface with fields:
  - `filesProcessed`: Total number of files scanned
  - `filesFixed`: Number of files where imports were modified
  - `importsFixed`: Array of version specifiers that were removed
  
- Modified `fixImportStatements()` to return a report object
- Added interactive notification after scaffolding completes:
  - Shows summary: "View Import Fix Report" button
  - Clicking button displays detailed modal with all fixes

**Benefits**:
- Developers understand what changes were made to their code
- Helps troubleshoot import-related issues
- Provides audit trail of automated changes

**Code Location**: `src/extension.ts`, lines 268-329

### 2. Component Preview Catalog (Feature 1)

**Purpose**: Generate a visual HTML catalog of all components exported from Figma Make.

**Implementation**:
- Created `generateComponentPreview()` function that:
  - Scans all `.jsx` and `.tsx` files in the src directory
  - Extracts component names and exported functions using regex
  - Generates a responsive HTML page with component cards
  - Displays component name, file path, and exports
  
- HTML features:
  - Clean, modern design with hover effects
  - Grid layout for easy browsing
  - Component cards with visual hierarchy
  - Responsive design for different screen sizes

- Saves to `COMPONENT_PREVIEW.html` in project root
- Shows notification with "Open Preview" button

**Benefits**:
- Immediate visibility into available components
- Quick reference while developing
- Helps understand project structure
- Aligns with Figma Make's design-to-code workflow

**Code Location**: `src/extension.ts`, lines 331-448

### 3. Configuration Management (Feature 3)

**Purpose**: Allow users to save and reuse scaffolding preferences across sessions.

**Implementation**:
- Created `ScaffoldConfig` interface with settings:
  - `autoStartDevServer`: Automatically run `npm run dev` after scaffolding
  - `autoOpenProject`: Automatically open project in new window
  - `generateComponentPreview`: Toggle component catalog generation
  
- Added configuration commands:
  - `figmaMake.configure`: Opens configuration dialog
  - Interactive QuickPick dialogs for each setting
  - Shows current values as context
  
- Storage:
  - Uses VS Code's `globalState` for persistence
  - Settings survive across VS Code restarts
  - `loadConfig()` and `saveConfig()` helper functions

- Integration:
  - Modified main scaffold function to respect configuration
  - Auto-applies configured actions without prompting
  - Falls back to manual selection if not configured

**Benefits**:
- Streamlines repetitive scaffolding tasks
- Reduces clicks for frequent users
- Customizable workflow to match team preferences
- Professional, enterprise-ready feature

**Code Location**: `src/extension.ts`, lines 11-65, 87-227

## Alignment with Figma Make Updates

These features align with Figma Make's latest updates in several ways:

1. **Component Preview** mirrors Figma Make's "Design Layer Copy" feature by providing a visual overview of design components in the codebase

2. **Import Reporting** addresses the increased complexity of modern React/TypeScript projects and AI-enhanced code generation

3. **Configuration Management** supports team workflows and automation, similar to Figma's workspace-level settings and integrations

## Technical Details

### Files Modified:
- `src/extension.ts`: Main implementation (288 lines changed)
- `package.json`: Added configure command, updated version
- `README.md`: Comprehensive documentation of new features
- `.gitignore`: Excluded generated HTML files
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Version history

### Compilation:
All code compiles successfully with TypeScript 4.9.4 with no errors or warnings.

### Dependencies:
No new dependencies added - uses existing VS Code API and Node.js standard library.

### Testing Approach:
Since there is no existing test infrastructure in the repository, manual testing is recommended:
1. Install extension from source
2. Test configuration command
3. Test scaffolding with various options
4. Verify import report generation
5. Verify component preview generation
6. Test persistence of settings across sessions

## Future Enhancements (Not Implemented)

Potential future additions could include:
- Component preview with visual thumbnails (requires headless browser)
- Export configuration profiles for team sharing
- Integration with Figma API for direct project import
- Automated testing with figma-make exports
- Custom import transformation rules
