# Figma Make Scaffolder - VS Code Extension (built upon the work of: https://github.com/likang/figma-make-local-runner)

> **Hey [@sucoro-ai](https://www.sucoro.com) & "Shouldn't have had to make this but here we are @figma..."**

> Look, this is what happens when you make a product that does ALMOST everything perfectly and solves a massive pain point in the design-to-dev world. We've all been there - those clients who want everything pixel-perfect, right? Figma Make gets us 95% of the way there, but then... well, here we are building workarounds.

> Shoutout to [@spetro511](https://surenscreations.com) for this figma-make-scaffolder - use it, love it, but fair warning: Figma will probably push an update tomorrow that breaks everything. Such is life! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## New Features (v1.1.0)

### 1. Import Fix Reporting
Get detailed visibility into the import fixing process:
- See which files were processed
- Know how many imports were fixed
- View the list of all version specifiers that were removed

This helps you understand what changes were made to your exported code and ensures transparency in the scaffolding process.

### 2. Component Preview Catalog
Automatically generate a visual HTML catalog of all components in your Figma Make export:
- Browse all exported components in one place
- See component names, file paths, and exports
- Quickly reference available components while developing

Enable this feature in the configuration settings.

### 3. Configuration Management
Save your scaffolding preferences to streamline your workflow:
- **Auto-start dev server**: Automatically run `npm run dev` after scaffolding
- **Auto-open project**: Automatically open the new project in a new VS Code window
- **Generate component preview**: Automatically create the component catalog

Access via Command Palette: "Configure Scaffolder Settings"


## Troubleshooting

### "Git not found"
Make sure Git is installed and available in your system PATH.

### "npm install failed"
The extension continues even if npm install has warnings. You can manually run `npm install` in the created project directory.

### "Import errors in generated code"
